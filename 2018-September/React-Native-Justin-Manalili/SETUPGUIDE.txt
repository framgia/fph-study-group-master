This is the source code for a basic "Noter App", built using React native.
LET'S GET CREATIVE WITH REACT NATIVE!

Setup Guide:
1.) Make sure you have node and npm installed
2.) Run ‘npm install –g react-native-cli’
3.) Go to a path where you would like to keep your project files and then run ‘react-native init noter’
4.) Copy all of the files you have here and then paste it into your 'noter' folder (replace if asked)
5.) Open Android Studio and open "Android" inside your 'noter' folder
6.) Go to Android Studio Tools > AVD Manager and then select your preferred Virtual Device
7.) cd into your 'noter' project directory (Run this command 'cd noter')
8.) Run 'npm add @babel/runtime'
9.) And then run 'react-native run-android' (To sync your code into your Virtual Device)

Happy Hacking!
